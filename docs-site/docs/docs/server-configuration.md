To change any of the default configuration, you'll need to copy the included [`config-template.yml`](https://github.com/polynote/polynote/blob/master/config-template.yml)
file to `config.yml`, and uncomment the sections you'd like to change. Check out the template itself for more information.

### Storage
Polynote stores backups of your notebooks in your browser. These backups are intended to be used as a last resort, 
in case something happened to the physical files on disk. This is not intended to replace a proper version history 
feature which may be implemented in the future. Be wary, as your browser may chose to delete these backups at any time! 

You can view or clear these backups in the [About Menu](#about-section).
